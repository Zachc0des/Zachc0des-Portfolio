  <h2>CIA TRIAD</h2>
  <p> The following three principles listed below work togegther to create a comprehensive security framework that protects information systems from various threats</p>
  <h3> C: Confidentiality </h3> 
  <p> Ensuring information is acessible only to authorized indivuduals</p>
  <h4>Examples: Encrypting Sensitive emails, Password-protecting files, Using acess control lists, Two-factor authentication,Data classification poloices
  <h3>I: Integrity</h3>
  <p>Maintaning accuracy & Consistency of data through its lifecycke</p>
  <h4>Examples: Digital signatures, Checksums & hasing, Version control systems,Aduit logs & trails, Input validation</h4>
  <h3>A: Availability</h3>
  <p>Ensuring authroized users have reliable access to information when needed </p>
  <h4>Examples: Regular backups, Redundant Systems, DDoS Protection, Diaster recovery plans, Load balancing</h4>
  </h3>  
  <h2>Risk Managment</h2>
  <h3>Identify</h3>
  <p>Discover potential threats & vulnerablitlites to your assets</p>
  <h3>Assess</h3>
  <p> Evulate likelihood & impact of each identified risk</p>
  <h3>Priotize</h3>
  <p>Rank risk based on severity & potential damage</p>
  <h3> Mitaigate </h3>
  <p>Implement controls to reduce or elimate risks</p>
  <h3>Monitor</h3>
  <p>Contiously review & update risk strategies</p>
  <h2>Threat Landscape:</h2>
    <h3>Ransomware Attacks</h3>
      <p>Malcious software that encrypts data & demandspayment for restoration, combining                 encryption with data theft threats</p>
    <h3>Phising & Social Enegineering </h3>
        <p>Depective tactics to manipulate indivudals into revealing senstiveinfomration or credntials. Evolving with AI-generated contetns & sophicated inpersonation techniques </p>
    <h3>Advanced Persistent Threats (APT)</h3>
   <p>Prolonged, stealthy cyberattacks where intruders gain acess to netwroks & remain undected for extended periods, often targeting senstive data and critical infrastrcture</p>
    <h3>AI-Powered Attacks</h3>
  <P> Levraging artificial intelligence to automate attacks, create convincing deepfakes, generate pokyoprhic malware, & conduct sophiscated reconnasissance at a unprecendeted scale</P>
    <h3>Cloud Security Vulenerablities</h3>
  <p>Misconfigured cloud services, inadequeaet acess controls & shared infrastrcutre risks. As organizations migrate to ckoud, attack surfaces expand with new vulnerabilities</p>
    <h3> Iot & Mobile Threats</h3>
  <P>Vulnerabilities in Internet of Things devices & mobile applicatoins. Weak security in connected devices creates entry points for broader network compromise</P>
    <h3>Supply Chain Attacks </h3>
      <p> Comprosing trusted third-party vendors, software dependencies, or hardware components to inflitrate target organizations through legitmate update mechanisms & trusted relationships</p>
    <h3> Zero-Day Exploits</h3> 
    Attacks previously unkown vulenerablities before vendors can develop patches. Increasingly weaponized & traded in underground markets for high-value targets  
    <h3>Insider Threats</h3>  
      <p>Malcious or negligent actions by employees,contractors, or partners with legitmate access. Can be intentional sabotage or unitentional security lapses causing data exposure.</p>
    <h3> Cryptocurrency & Defi Attacks </h3>
      <p> Exploiting vulnerablities in blockchain platforms, smart contracts & crypto exchanges. Growing target as cryptocurrency adoptions increases, with billions stolen anually</p>
    <h3> Quantum Computing Threats </h3>
      <p> Future threat from quantum computers capable of breaking current encryption standards.Organizations must prepare for "Harvest now decrypt later" attacks collecting ecncrypted today.</p>
    <h3> Denial of Service (DDoS)</h3>
      <p> Overwhelming systems with massive traffic volumes to disrupt service availability. INcreasingly used for extortion or as diversinoary tactics during other attacks</p>
    <h2>Security Frame Works</h2>
    <h3>NIST Cybersecurity framework</h3>
      <p>A flexible framework for manging cybersecuirty risks across organizaions of all sizes<br><br>
      Key Functions<br><br>
        Identify:<br>
        Protect:<br>
        Detect:<br>
        Respond:<br>
        Recover:</p>
      <h5>Exmaple: A hosptial uses NIST CSF to identify cirtical patient data systems, implement access controls, moniotr for breaches, and establish incident response procedures</h5>
     <h3>ISO 27001 </h3>
     <p>International standard for infomration security managmenet systems (ISMS)<br><br>
     Key functions<br><br>
       Risk Assessment:<br>
       Security Controls:<br>
       Continious Imrpoveement:<br>
       Compliance:
     </p>
     <h5> Example: A financial service company achieves ISO 27001 ceritifcation to demonstarte secure handling of customer data to clients & regulator</h5>
     <h3> CIS Controls </h3>
     <p>Priotized set of 18 actionable security controls to defend against common cyber attacks<br><br>
     Key Functions<br><br>
     Asset Managment:<br>
     Access Control:<br>
     Data Protection:<br>
     Incident Response:
     <h5>Example: A small business implements CIS Controls by first inventorying all devices, then securing configurations & enabling multi factor authentication </h5>
    <h3>SOC 2</h3>
    <p> Trust service creiteria for service organizations handling customer data<br><br>
    Key Functions
    Security:<br>
    Availability:<br>
    Confidentiality:<br>
    Privacy:<br>
    Processing Intergirty:</p>
    <h5>Exmaple:A cloud software provider undergoes SOC 2 audit to prove to enterprise clinets that their systems meet security &availability standards </h5>
    <h3> COBIT</h3>
