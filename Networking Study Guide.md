<h1>The Seven layers of Osi Model</h1>

<h3>Layer 7:Application</h3>
  <p1>This where network applications and their protocols operate. It is what users directly interact with- web browsers, email clients, file transfer programs. Protocols include HTTP/HTTPS</p1>
  <h5> Example: </h5>
<h3>Layer 6:Presentation Layer</h3>
<p1>Handles data formatting, encyrption, and compression. It ensures data from the application layer can be understood by the receiving system, magning things like character encoding (ASCII,Unicode) and file formats</p1>
 <h5> Example: </h5>
<h3>Layer 5: Session Layer</h3>
<p1> Manages communication sessions between applications. It establishesm, maintains, and terminates connections, handlings things like authentication and session checkpoints for recovery2</p1>
 <h5> Example: </h5>
<h3>Layer 4:Transport Layer</h3>
<p1>Provides reliable data transfer between end systems. TCP (reliable connection-oriented) & <BR> UDP (Fast connectionless) operate here. This layer handles segmentation,flow control and error recovery</p1>
 <h5> Example: </h5>
<h3>Layer 3: Network Layer</h3>
<p1>Reposnbile for routing data between different netwroks. IP (Internet Protocol) operates at this layer, determing the best path for data packets to reach their destinatoin across multiple networks.</p1>
 <h5> Example: </h5>
<h3>Layer 2: Data Link Layer</h3>
<p1>Handles communication between adjacent network nodes on the same physical network, Ethernet opeartes here manging MAC addresses and ensuring reliable transmission over the phsyical meduim</p1>
 <h5> Example: </h5>
<h3>Layer 1: Physical Layer</h3>
<p1>The Actual hardware cables,wireless signals, voltage levels and timing it defines the electrical and physical specifications for transmitting raw bits</p1>
 <h5> Example: </h5>
