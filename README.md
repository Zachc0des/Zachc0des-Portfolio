<h1>Hello, I'm Zachary! <br/></<a> Information Technology Trade School Graduate ⌄</a>

<h2> ☁About me☁ </h2>
<br><a>I’m 22 year old Tech Enthusiast, orignally from Canada Ontario now based in Palm Beach Florida with a strong background in customer service, having over five years of experience in various customer-facing roles. I studied on campus at Miami Job Corps while also commuting to Dade Institute of Technology, further expanding my knowledge and skill set.

From a young age, technology has been an integral part of my life—learning to use a computer at the same age I learned to read. This early exposure sparked a deep passion for the ever-evolving world of technology, and I continuously seek to expand my knowledge in this field. Beyond tech, I’m also passionate about fitness, valuing both physical and mental well-being.

With a blend of customer service expertise, technical curiosity, and a drive for learning, I’m always looking for new opportunities to grow and apply my skills.</a></b>
